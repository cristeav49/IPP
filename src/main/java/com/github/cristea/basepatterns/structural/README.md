##### <a id="Adapter"></a>Adapter
* Story

Allows that interface of an existing class to be used from another interface.

Adapters are often used in daily life, for example eletrical adapter is a device that 
converts attributes of one electrical device or system to those of an otherwise incompatible device or system. 
Some modify power or signal attributes, while others merely adapt the physical form of one electrical connector to another.

##### <a id="Bridge"></a>Bridge
* Story

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

Steering wheel is an example of the Bridge.
The purpose of a steering wheel is to transmit  driver's input to the steered wheels in order to dynamically change direction of the vehicle.
There are different implementations of the steering wheels used in cars, buses, tracks, tractors and formulas.

##### <a id="Facade"></a>Facade
* Story

Facade hides the complexity of the system and provides an interface to the client from where the client can access the system.

You want to organize a marriage reception with dinner for 100 people. 
So in order to organize such event, you need to find and decorate a hall where the event will happen, 
then you need to find a music, organize flowers, send invitations and so on and so on.

If this is to much for you than you can find event manager which will organize event for you. 

This is a typical example for Facade.

```

##### <a id="Flyweight"></a>Flyweight
* Story

Remove duplicates.

Flyweight pattern is used to reduce memory by loading only the data necessary to perform action.
Database normalization is flyweight. Normalisation, is the process of organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to minimize data redundancy.

##### <a id="Proxy"></a>Proxy
* Story

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Envoy Extraordinary is a Proxy. 
He is an accredited messenger, agent, or representative who is sent by one government to represent it in dealing with another government.
